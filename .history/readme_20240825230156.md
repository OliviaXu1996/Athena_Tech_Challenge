## Load Data Into Suitable Database Model

**Data Sources**：
CSV Files

- Accounting_Entry
- Equitable_Owner
- Equitable_Owner_History

Tables(MySQL):

- Accounting_Entry
- Equitable_Owner
- ATH_Equitable_Owner_History
- Loan_Account

**Loading Data**：

  Data PreProcess: data_preprocess.py()
  Create Database:   `create database athena_challege;`
  Create Tables:

'''
CREATE TABLE Equitable_Owner (
    Id varchar(18) primary key,
    Name varchar(255) not null);

CREATE TABLE Loan_Account(
  Id varchar(18) primary key);

CREATE table ATH_Equitable_Owner_History(
    Equitable_Owner_History_Id int auto_increment primary key,
    Reallocation_Date Date not null, 
    From_Equitable_Owner_Id varchar(18) null, 
    Equitable_Owner_Id varchar(18) not null,
    Loan_Account_Id varchar(18) not null,
    CONSTRAINT fk_from
        FOREIGN KEY (From_Equitable_Owner_Id) REFERENCES Equitable_Owner(Id)
        ON DELETE SET NULL
        ON UPDATE CASCADE,
    CONSTRAINT fk_to
        FOREIGN KEY (Equitable_Owner_Id) REFERENCES Equitable_Owner(Id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
        ON UPDATE CASCADE,
    CONSTRAINT fk_loan
        FOREIGN KEY (Loan_Account_Id) REFERENCES Loan_Account(Id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
        ON UPDATE CASCADE
 );

CREATE TABLE Accounting_Entry (
    Id VARCHAR(18) primary key,
    Transaction_Date DATE not null,
    Loan_Account_Id VARCHAR(18) not null,
    Credit_Amount NUMERIC not null,
    Credit_GL_Account_code VARCHAR(10) not null,
    Debit_Amount NUMERIC not null,
    Debit_GL_Account_code VARCHAR(10) not null,
    CONSTRAINT fk_loan_account
        FOREIGN KEY (Loan_Account_Id) REFERENCES Loan_Account(Id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
        ON UPDATE CASCADE
);
```

* Load Data: Import Data  -> Check Schema Mapping -> Preview Data ....

****Note:** Cuz Equitable_Owner_History first row  'From_Equitable_Owner_Id' is null,  before we load data to MySQL table, we need `set foreign_key_checks=0` otherwise, it will show following **error**.
*sql error [1452] [23000]: cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails (`athena_challenge`.`ath_equitable_owner_history`, constraint `fk_from` foreign key (`from_equitable_owner_id`) references `equitable_owner` (`id`) on delete set null on update cascade)*

## Build a new model

**Build a new which assigns the correct equitable owner name for each accounting entry, given:**

* equitable owner record reallocation date is the same as the accounting entry transaction date or,
* equitable owner record reallocation date is the most recent to the accounting entry transaction date
* note: there will only ever be a single equitable owner record for a loan id and reallocation date

Please run **"model.sql:"**

## Stretching (If Tech Stack Includes: DBT)

##### How would you test that this model is behaving predictably in a production environment?
Unit Tests and Data validation:
    Schema Test: we can create a dbt test yml file:
        For  EG:
        models:
            - name: accounting_entries
                columns:
                - name: loan_account_id
                    tests:
                    - not_null
                    - unique
                - name: transaction_date
                    tests:
                    - not_null
                - name: equitable_owner_name
                    tests:
                    - not_null
Custom SQL Tests:
--- tests/check_correct_owner.sql:
    SELECT
      COUNT(*)
    FROM {{ ref('accounting_entries') }}
    WHERE transaction_date < reallocation_date
    AND correct_equitable_owner IS NOT NULL;

..... run 






##### How would you deploy this model to create a dataset that would be accessible for analytics?
